Mathematics Study Guide

Chapter 1: Algebra
Algebra is the branch of mathematics that deals with symbols and the rules for manipulating those symbols. Key concepts include:

Variables: Letters that represent unknown numbers
Equations: Mathematical statements that show equality between two expressions
Linear Equations: Equations of the form ax + b = c
Quadratic Equations: Equations of the form ax² + bx + c = 0

Important Formulas:
- Quadratic Formula: x = (-b ± √(b²-4ac)) / 2a
- Slope Formula: m = (y₂-y₁) / (x₂-x₁)
- Distance Formula: d = √((x₂-x₁)² + (y₂-y₁)²)

Chapter 2: Geometry
Geometry studies shapes, sizes, and properties of space. Essential topics:

Triangles: Three-sided polygons with angle sum of 180°
Circles: Round shapes with radius, diameter, and circumference
Area Formulas:
- Triangle: A = ½ × base × height
- Circle: A = πr²
- Rectangle: A = length × width

Chapter 3: Calculus
Calculus deals with rates of change and accumulation. Core concepts:

Derivatives: Measure rate of change
Integrals: Measure accumulation
Limits: Foundation of calculus
Functions: Mathematical relationships between variables

Practice Problems:
1. Solve: 2x + 5 = 13
2. Find the area of a circle with radius 7
3. Calculate the derivative of f(x) = x²

Study Tips:
- Practice regularly with different problem types
- Understand concepts before memorizing formulas
- Work through examples step by step
- Review previous chapters before exams
